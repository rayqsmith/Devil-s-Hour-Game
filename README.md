## Summary
Devil’s Hour is a top-down horror/puzzle game where the player must escape a demonic home by solving increasingly difficult challenges while they race against the clock. Players will spend their ever-decreasing supply of time performing actions and solving riddles, all to escape this horrific abode before the Devil’s Hour begins at 3:33 AM…

## Background 
Game was developed as a requirement for a UG computer science course. We were responsible for designing, and making a 2D computer game and were also responsible for creating all the assets within the game (except for the music).
